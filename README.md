The following project is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to make a html webpage to practice & review HTML and other concepts covered in the curriculum to date. 

The skills I learned in this project are to build a basic HTMl website. I learned how to use git, display information on website, link between pages using absolute and relate refrences, and work with lists.
