    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This is a very flavorful recipe from North India, usually eaten with fried bread like bhatura or puri. 
        I like to serve it over rice for a very filling meal. You can also try it as a quick snack over toasted bread. 
        This recipe is much quicker to make if you use precooked canned beans, but I like to think that the authentic 
        flavor comes from doing it the hard way!
