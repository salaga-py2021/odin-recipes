    <h1> Cholay (Curried Chickpeas) Recipe </h1>
    <img src = "../img/cholay.png" alt = "Yummy Picture of Cholay (Curried Chickpeas)"> 
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This is a very flavorful recipe from North India, usually eaten with fried bread like bhatura or puri. 
        I like to serve it over rice for a very filling meal. You can also try it as a quick snack over toasted bread. 
        This recipe is much quicker to make if you use precooked canned beans, but I like to think that the authentic 
        flavor comes from doing it the hard way!

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol type = 'i'> 
        <li> 
            Place the 2 cups water, tea bag, and bay leaf into a pot, and bring water to a boil. 
            Reserving about 1/2 cup garbanzo beans, stir the beans into the boiling water. 
            When beans are heated through, discard the tea bag and bay leaf. 
            Remove from heat. Drain the beans, reserving water, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the sliced 
            onion until tender. Remove from heat, cool, and mix in the reserved garbanzo 
            beans, 1 tomato, and 1/2 the cilantro leaves. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Blend in the coriander, 
            cumin seeds, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir for 15 to 20 seconds, until lightly 
            browned. Mix in the turmeric. Stir the chopped onion into the skillet, and cook until 
            tender. Mix in the remaining tomatoes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala. 
            Bring the tomato liquid to a boil, and cook about 5 minutes. Stir in the boiled garbanzo 
            beans, sliced onion mixture, and enough of the reserved water to attain a thick, gravy-like 
            consistency. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes. Garnish with the remaining cilantro leaves to serve.
