    <h3> Ingredients </h3> 
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup whole wheat flour </li>
        <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> Â¾ cup hot water or as needed </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol type = 'i'> 
        <li> 
            Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive 
            oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead 
            dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. 
            Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly 
            floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.
        </li>
        <li> 
            When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. 
            Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 
            seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.
        </li>
    </ol>
